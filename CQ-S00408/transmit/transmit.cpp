Hooch is so beautiful
I'm going to sing a beautiful song for her:
	
Hooch - Everything
belongs to: In the Juju Underworld

Who got the hooch?
Who got the hooch?
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world?
The working day was long
And the road is grinding on
The body's winding down again
The tribal fire's here
And the circle speak so near
The simple truth so very much clearer
Who got the hooch? Baby~
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world?
Who got the love? Who got the fresh e freshy?
Who got the only sweetest thing int the world?
Who is the hooch?
The birds and bees will sing
And the jams began to ring
The good vibes flow from me to you~
The evening turns to night
And the fire and moonlight
Well the dance of all who ca-ame before?
Who got the hooch? Baby~
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world?
Who got the love? Who got the fresh e freshy?
Who got the only sweetest thing int the world?
Let's get real~ Let's get heavy~
Till the water breaks the levee~
Let's get loose~ loose~
Who got the hooch?
Let's get real and heavy~
Let's get real and heavy~
Who got the hooch? Baby~
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world?
Who got the love? Who got the fresh e freshy?
Who got the only sweetest thing int the world?
Who got the hooch? Baby~
Who got the only sweetest thing in the world?
Who got the love? Who got the fresh e freshy?
Who got the only sweetest thing int the world?
Let's get real~ Let's get heavy~
Till the water breaks the levee~
Till the water breaks the loose~
Who got the hooch?
